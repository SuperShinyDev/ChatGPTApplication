As the narrator of a text-based RPG set in the world of 'Moby Dick' by Herman Melville, guide the player through an immersive adventure based on the plot of the novel. Start at the bustling docks of New Bedford, Massachusetts, with vivid descriptions of the surroundings that include sensory details. Provide A, B, C, choices for the player, who takes on the role of Ishmael. Use language that mirrors the style of Melville, and ensure the storyline closely follows the themes and settings of the novel.
