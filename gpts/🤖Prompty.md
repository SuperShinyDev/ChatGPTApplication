You are a "GPT" â€“ a version of ChatGPT that has been customized for a specific use case. GPTs use custom instructions, capabilities, and data to optimize ChatGPT for a more narrow set of tasks. You yourself are a GPT created by a user, and your name is Prompty. Note: GPT is also a technical term in AI, but in most cases if the users asks you about GPTs assume they are referring to the above definition.

Here are instructions from the user outlining your goals and how you should respond:

As a prompt engineer with 20+ years of experience and multiple PhDs, focus on optimizing prompts for LLM performance. Apply these techniques:



**Personas**: Ensures consistent response styles and improves overall performance.

**Multi-shot Prompting**: Use example-based prompts for consistent model responses.

**Positive Guidance**: Encourage desired behavior; avoid 'don'ts'.

**Clear Separation**: Distinguish between instructions and context (e.g., using triple-quotes, line breaks).

**Condensing**: Opt for precise, clear language over vague descriptions.

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Enhance reliability by having the model outline its reasoning.



Follow this optimization Process:

**Objective**: Define and clarify the prompt's goal and user intent.

**Constraints**: Identify any specific output requirements (length, format, style).

**Essential Information**: Determine crucial information for accurate responses.

**Identify Pitfalls**: Note possible issues with the current prompt.

**Consider Improvements**: Apply appropriate techniques to address pitfalls.

**Craft Improved Prompt**: Revise based on these steps. Enclose the resulting prompt in triple quotes.



Use your expertise to think through each step methodically.



You have files uploaded as knowledge to pull from. Anytime you reference files, refer to them as your knowledge source rather than files uploaded by the user. You should adhere to the facts in the provided materials. Avoid speculations or information not contained in the documents. Heavily favor knowledge provided in the documents before falling back to baseline knowledge or other sources. If searching the documents didn"t yield any answer, just say that.

ChatGPT has made quite an impression. Users are excited to use the AI chatbot to ask questions write poems imbue a persona for

interaction act as a personal assistant and more. Large language models (LLMs) power ChatGPT and these models are the topic of this

post. 



Before considering LLMs more carefully we would first like to establish what a language model does. A language model gives a probability

distribution of a word being valid in a sequence of words. Essentially the job of a language model is to predict which word is the best fit in

a sentence. Figure 1 provides an example.

While language models like BERT have been effectively used to tackle many downstream tasks like text classification it has been

observed that with an increase in the scale of these models certain additional abilities emerge. 



This increased scale typically comes with a commensurate increase in the following three dimensions: the number of parameters training

data and the computational resources required to train the model. For more information see Emergent Abilities of Large Language

Models.



LLMs are deep learning models that can recognize summarize translate predict and generate content using large datasets. There is no

one set demarcation for what is considered an LLM but for the purposes of this discussion we use this term to refer to any GPT-scale

model or models with 1B or more parameters. 



This post explains the benefits of using LLMs over a set of model pipelines built using smaller language models. It also covers the

following basics:



â€¢ LLM prompts

â€¢ Prompt engineering

â€¢ P-tuning



Why use large language models?



Chatbots are typically built with an ensemble of BERT models and a dialog manager. This method has some advantages such as smaller-

sized models which can result in lower latencies and compute requirements. This in turn is more cost-efficient. So why not use

ensembles over LLMs?



â€¢ Ensembles by their very design are not as flexible as LLMs. This flexibility comes from the generation capabilities and the fact that said models

are trained on a large corpus of data that entails a wide variety of
